This project aims to achieve the primary and basic functions and features of a social network, such as facebook, for example. It's a project made alongside my course in [B7Web](https://b7web.com.br/fullstack/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMI-7eYj5vT-QIVEz6RCh2VfgXQEAAYASAAEgJfifD_BwE&ref=I24108426I), pursuing to solidify the concepts of OO (object oriented programming), MVC (model, view, controoler), databases (MySQL, in this case), SOLID principles and most importantly, PHP language. Also, used html, css and javascript for the front-end of the application.

## See Devsbook in action

- The easiest way will to test it will be with an Apache server and a MySQL database running in your machine, locally;

- First, set your sql database as shown in [here](https://github.com/valmarath/devsbook/tree/main/database_config);

- To access the application, you will be oriented by it to make a registration process, as in any website;

- Then, you will be already setted up to test devsbook, making posts, editing your profile, liking friends posts (you can create other accounts and be friends with it, being able to do interactions) and so on.
